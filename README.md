# ast-demo

 This example test uses eclipse JDT libraries to programmatically create a java class
 by using the simple version of AST API (NOT with ASTRewrite).
 
It also creates a java source file to store the newly created class and uses Reflection API to dynamically load the class,
run a method to validate the successful compilation and make the test more thorough
